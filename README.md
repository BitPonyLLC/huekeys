This is app is still a work-in-progress. The goal is to create a robust tool for managing the RGB keyboard on System76 laptops. The only method System76 provides for changing the colors and brightness of the keyboard is via built-in keys. This app aims to give users greater control over the keyboard.

Currently, it will only rotate the keyboard backlight through a RGB rainbow. Only tested on the Darter, but it should work on other System76 models.
